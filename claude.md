# Claude Code Guidelines

## Git Workflow
- **Push commits after each code change** with brief, descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format when appropriate (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`)

## GitHub Issues
- Use the `gh` CLI tool for managing GitHub issues associated with this project
- Common commands:
  - `gh issue list` - View open issues
  - `gh issue create` - Create a new issue
  - `gh issue view <number>` - View issue details
  - `gh issue close <number>` - Close an issue
